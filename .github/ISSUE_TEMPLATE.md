## Transfer Ownership

We would like to transfer the ownership of this plugin to the sensu-plugins organization in hopes of better community support and exposure. I have reviewed [the skeleton plugin](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins-skel) for best practices.

Repo to transfer:

<!-- keep this next line if true -->
I am also interested in continuing to help as a maintainer of this plugin üëç

<!-- Facilitating the transfer --->
When a maintainer has been assigned to the issue unless otherwise indicated you can transfer the repo to them following the instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-personal-account/. They will then be able to facilitate a transfer to the org. In some cases not all maintainers may have access and they may ask you to transfer to a specific maintainer who has access to transfer org repos.
