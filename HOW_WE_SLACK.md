# How We Slack

Thanks for joining our Community Slack! This page will walk you through our approach. If you have any questions about anything here, please don't hesitate to contact the Community team at [community@sensu.io](mailto:community@sensu.io).

## Who We Are

The Sensu Community is a mix of open source open source users, developers, enterprise customers and monitoring enthusiasts. We encourage all members to participate in the collective learning happening everyday.

## Channels of Interest

We have a somewhat unique approach to channels that we hope you enjoy. Here are the highlights:

| Channel             | Purpose                                                                  |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **#monitoringlove** | Default channel for all things Sensu as well as open discussion          |
| **#announcements**  | A read-only channel for major updates from the leadership team           |
| **#contributing**   | Dedicated place to offer or discussion contribution to the Sensu project |
| **#help**           | A breakout channel for detailed troubleshooting                          |

We also break out into speciality channels. As an example, you might start a conversation in one of the project-focused channels, like `#plugins`, `#extensions` or `#core`, and then hop into `#help` to dive deeper. You might open a PR to fix a known issue and mention it in `#contributing`. You will also see channels for each major configuration management tool (like `#cm-puppet`, `#cm-chef`, and so on). Additional channels are welcome as needed.

## Administration

This Slack organization is maintained by the community team of Sensu Inc with help from maintainers. The list of all maintainers [is available here](README.md). You can reach all of us simply by typing `@maintainers` in any channel of Slack. If you want to privately contact an administrator, please email `community@sensu.io`.

## Slack-tiquette

Here are a few tips to make your time on Slack fun and productive. When in doubt, refer to [our Code of Conduct](https://sensuapp.org/conduct). Feel free to ask questions in the `#monitoringlove` channel as well.

### Non-SLA on Questions

This Slack is full of helpful folks, but is not bound by an SLA. For Sensu Enterprise customers, use [support@sensu.io](mailto:support@sensu.io) if you need a speedy response. If you are interested in paid support for Sensu, please [visit the website to compare options](https://sensuapp.org/support#compare).

### Notification Policies

Slack offers two channel-wide broadcast aliases: `@channel` and `@here`. This community is setup where only Admins can use them in order to prevent alert fatigue.

### Repeat Questions

There will be times when questions are asked and do not receive an answer. Feel free to repeat your question later on when more people are around, or wait for a community member to scrollback and answer it.

### Setup your Profile

Once registered, all members have access to customize their profile [through the Slack
website](https://chefcommunity.slack.com/account/profile). We appreciate when you add a distinct avatar and other details about themselves so others can get to know you.

### Sharing Policies

We do ask any content that is not directly related to Sensu or the monitoring ecosystem is kept out of this Slack. When in doubt, use thoughtful judgement and always consider [our Code of Conduct](https://sensuapp.org/conduct).

We also ask that community members help in the curation of the conversations happening in the channels they care about. If a member posts something not relevant to a channel you're in, ask them to share it in `#monitoringlove` or to not share links like that in the future. If you run into any challenges with this policy, please email [community@sensu.io](mailto:community@sensu.io).

### Vote with your Feet

You are more than welcome to leave channels and rejoin them at any time. The only "required" channel for everyone to be in is `#announcements`.

## FAQ

* **What do you like about Slack?**
  * Slack is an application that almost everyone has open all the time. Signing into the Sensu community gets that much easier thanks to it. It also gives us multiple channels, app integrations that are easy to setup and a beautiful user experience.
* **Why did you leave IRC?**
  * It came down to a judgement call that IRC was too difficult for new Users to get involved. We needed more channels like Slack offers with consistent accounts so people can find answers after that logout.  
* **I Really Like IRC, What Do I Do?**
  * Slack does offer an [IRC gateway](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connecting-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP),
though it has historically had some quirky behavior
