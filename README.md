## Sensu Plugins Feature Requests

Your place to contribute to Sensu plugins and their maintainers.

## Background

Sensu plugins can be found [all over GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sensu-plugin&type=). Community maintainers of Sensu collect them, code review and manage their releases under the [Sensu Plugins organization](https://github.com/sensu-plugins). This results in [the many gems](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=sensu-plugin) we all rely on.

## How to Use This Repo

Please [open Issues](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins-feature-requests/issues) for anything on your mind that will help the community succeed at having **the best collection of monitoring plugins.**

Common requests are:

* Transfer ownership of your rad Sensu plugin to this organization ([example][1])
* Offer an awesome idea that will help others make great plugins ([example][3])

## How You Can Help

The success of Sensu depends on its contributors. You can always help the maintainers by:

* [Reviewing open PRs][4] (especially if you're familiar with problem it solves)
* Helping review and comment on [open Issues][5] (especially older ones)
* Opening PRs that resolve [open Issues][5]
* Volunteer as a maintainer (but only after you've done :point_up: a bunch first)

And **thank you** for your contribution. It adds to the monitoring :heart:.
