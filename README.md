1. [Reviewing open PRs][4] (especially if you're familiar with the technology involved)
1. Helping review and comment on [open Issues][5] (especially older ones)
1. Opening PRs that resolve [open Issues][5]
1. By volunteering as a maintainer (but after you've done :point_up: a bunch first)

And **thank you** for your contribution. It adds to the #monitoringlove :heart:.

## About the Sensu Plugins organization

Sensu plugins can be found [all over GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sensu-plugin&type=). Community maintainers of Sensu collect them, code review and manage their releases under the [Sensu Plugins organization](https://github.com/sensu-plugins) and [Sensu Extensions organization](https://github.com/sensu-extensions). This results in [the many gems](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=sensu-plugin) we all rely on.
